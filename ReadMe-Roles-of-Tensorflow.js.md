# What does `Tensorflow.js` function and methods stands for? What do they do?

- 1. This is a project template for [introducing-Tensorflow.js.]
- 2. This project template will let you know about what does `Tensorflow.js` stands for and
`Introduce role of Tensorflow.js`.



## Process of introduce `Tensorflow.js` and apply to your own project.


### Asynchronous function, `trainNewModel` 

Set up an `asynchronous function`, called `trainNewModel`.


### Dense-Layer or a fully-connected Layer.

- 1. Adding a `Dense-Layer` or a fully connected Layer that will output a shape of one and also take an input with a shape one. 

- 2. Define the loss metric which in this case will be ```meanSquaredError```, and minimize the ```meanSquaredError``` of the predictions from the algorithm.

- 3. Define an `optimizer` which is the function that determines how we reach this ```actual Minimum-Error-Point```.

- 4. `SGD` statnds for ```stochastic-gradient-descent```, and there's a number of ```different optimizers```that you can choose from.


### Training-Model.

- 1. Get a `Machine-Learning algorith` to predict and training ```Data```.

- 2. Depending on the ```size of the DataSet``` training the model can take a ```long-time```, but it just have few values, so it's going to happen very quick.
