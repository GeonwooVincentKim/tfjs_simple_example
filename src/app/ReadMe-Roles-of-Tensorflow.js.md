   1. Set up an asynchronous function, 
    called 'trainNewModel'.

    2. Adding a Dense-Layer or a fully connected Layer
    that will output a shape of one and also take 
    an input with a shape one. 

    3. Define the loss metric which in this case,
    will be 'meanSquaredError', and minimize the 'meanSquaredError' of the predictions
    from the algorithm.

    4. Define an optimizer which is the function that
    determines how we reach this actual Minimum-Error-Point.

    5. SGD statnd sfor stochastic-gradient-descent,
    and there's a number of different optimizers that you can
    choose from.
